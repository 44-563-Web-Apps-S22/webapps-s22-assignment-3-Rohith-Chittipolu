                    <h2>Gauss method for solving system of linear equations</h2>
                    <blockquote> In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.
                         It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. 
                         This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. 
                         The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) although some special cases of the method—albeit presented without proof—were known to Chinese mathematicians as early as circa 179 CE.[1]
